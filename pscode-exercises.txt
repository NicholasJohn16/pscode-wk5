// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

remainder = num % 2
if remainder == 0
    print "even"
else
    print "odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


define num1, num2, num3, num4, num5;
sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5;
average = sum / 5;
define smallest, largest = average;

foreach num in nums:
    if num < smallest
        smallest = num
    if num > largest
        largest = num

print "average:" + average
print "smallest" + smallest
print "largest" + largest
